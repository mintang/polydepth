# Introduction #

Real-time penetration depth computation library for _polygon-soup_ models.

# Functions #

For two intersected polygonal models, _PolyDepth_ can compute a minimum distance to separate them by translation:
  * It can compute a single distance value to separate the intersected model
  * It can also report a set of distance values for each intersected _region_
  * It has different options to choose for initialization
