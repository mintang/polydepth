# Introduction #
We present a real-time translational penetration depth (PD) computation library, PolyDepth, which can calculate translational PD for complicated polygon-soup models consisting of tens of thousands triangles at interactive rates.

Given two intersected models, PolyDepth can compute the global and local penetration depth between them.

# Prerequisites #

To run PolyDepth, two external libraries are needed, PQP and C<sup>2</sup>A. PQP can be downloaded from http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/SSV/. C<sup>2</sup>A can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/c2a-ewha/.

Currently, PolyDepth can be compiled on VC9.0 and tested on Windows OS.
